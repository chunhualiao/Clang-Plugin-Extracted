This work extracts the plugin feature from Clang into a standalone example.

We have simplified this feature and integrated it into ROSE.
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/ROSE_Compiler_Framework/Plugin

#------------------------------
version 1: orginal stripped version from Clang (C++11) 

version 2: simplified version, merging two classes into one (C++11)

version 3: eliminated C++11 to only use C++98

A smallest example to mimic the plugin mechanism in CLANG/LLVM
* merged ASTConsumer and FrontEndAction into a single class for simplicity
* no argument parsing support.

List of files
* main.C   // main entry: specifying plugin .so file and action name
* makefile
* plugin.h   // plugin header file
* plugin.C    // plugin source file
* PrintNames.C // the user-provided plugin implementing preorder traverse of the tree, register the action

#------------------------------
To test a version
 cd version{1|2|3}
 make check

To clean up, type:
  make clean
